# VGL Development Toolbox

This is a Visual Studio Code extension for supporting VGL development. Currently, this includes partial syntax highlighting for VGL code (`*.rpf`, `*.sxf`, and `*.caf` files) and database structure definition files (`structure.txt`). Further functionality is under development.

## Installation

Install this extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IanCooper.code-vgl) or download the repository manually and extract to `~/.vscode/extensions` on your computer.
